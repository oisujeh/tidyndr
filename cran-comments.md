## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

-   Fixed the error related to the `disaggregate()`

-   Disaggregated `current_age` column into finer age-groups to align with the PEPFAR MER 2.6 guidance

-   Added a trailing slash and followed the moved content for "https://app.codecov.io/gh/stephenbalogun/tidyndr?branch=master"

-   Corrected an error related to the `tx_new()` function in  the `readme.md` file

## Test environments

-   local R installation, R 4.1.2
-   ubuntu 20.04 (release), R 4.1.2
-    macOS-latest (release), 4.1.2
-   win-builder (devel)

## R CMD check results
